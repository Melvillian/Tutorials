# Properties

## SafeMath

1. safeAdd always reverts on overflow
2. safeAdd results in the correct sum of the 2 inputs
3. safeSub always reverts on underflow
4. safeAdd results in the correct subtraction of the 2 inputs

## Token

1. sum of balances always equals totalSupply
2. transferTo does not change totalSupply
3. mint increases balances and totalSupply correctly

## AuctionImpl

1. only owner can create a new auction
2. auction prize is monotonically decreasing (or remains the same) for all calls
3. token balance of caller always decreases when bid is called, and token balance of previous winner always increases
4. every successful call to bid results in msg.sender == winner
5. `close` results in totalsupply increasing by prize amount
6. the totaly supply can only go up with a successful call to close
7. bid_expiry and end_time never decrease
8. iff an address is the lowest bid, then they are the only one to receive tokens
9. iff an address is the lowest bid, then they receive tokens equal to their bid (this is a stronger version of the above rule)
10. only 1 user can receive tokens


## Additional Changes after looking at propertiesList.md

1. the only way to increase your balance of token (excluding external transfers) is to be the msg.sender and to have called `close`
2. the only way to cancel a bid is if it's closed
3.
